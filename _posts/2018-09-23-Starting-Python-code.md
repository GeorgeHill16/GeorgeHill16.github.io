    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered this week because I was stuck on a question for 15 mins and I didn't click the hint button but it was tempting, I read through my code 4 times before realising my mistake.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I always questioned my work whenever it was wrong so then I knew what my mistake was.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Independence</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my work when it was right so if something like that happened again I would know what to do if another question came up like that.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged with the lesson because I wanted t get as much of the work done as possible and also do it correctly.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have read all of the instructions for each question because on some of them I just guessed what to do.</td>
